# QAP Algorithms
This repo contains a bunch of implementations of algorithms, either exact or using metaheuristics, for solving the [Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_assignment_problem). It was developed as the main assignment of the DIM0605 - PROJETO E AN√ÅLISE DE ALGORITMOS (algorithm projecting and analysis).

# Exact Algorithm
- Branch-and-Bound

# Metaheuristics
- Tabu Search
- Genetic Algorithm
- Hybrid Algorithm

## Compilation
To compile the code, execute the following command:
```
make
```

## Usage
To run the project, execute the following command, where `INSTANCES` is the path to a file containing addresses of instances of the QAP:
```
./exe.out INSTANCES
